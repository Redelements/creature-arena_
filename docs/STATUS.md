# Status: handoff snapshot

Stamped: 2026-10-29
Branch: local-seats (stacked on local-mp-plan = PR #317)
Trigger: phase

This is a snapshot, not a log: overwrite it, keep it under 150 lines. A fresh session reads
this and CLAUDE.md, states the next step in one line and continues (no re-exploration).

## Current state

Job: the eight implementation PRs of `docs/local-multiplayer-plan.md` (section 4), each
stacked on the previous branch, Kevin playtests and merges. PR 0 (the plan + rulings) is #317
on branch `local-mp-plan`.

Rulings (Kevin, Oct 29, in the plan's section 5 and `docs/decisions.md`): four seats at most,
pads only in 3-4 player games (2P modes keep keyboard for player 1), one shared camera, hybrid
later, **player 1 alone pauses**, **only player 1 earns progression**, one gamepad remap and one
pad layout for every seat, FFA single round + Rematch, mode C on stadium maps + Twin Keeps,
Brawl 2/3/4 rows become aliases.

Now: PR 1 "seats" on `local-seats`: `src/input/local_seats.gd` (LocalSeats: assign, pad_lost /
pad_found hot-plug, seat_of_device, owner_of_event, rumble_device), `PlayerInput.pad_map()` so
`_device_pad_bits` follows the gamepad remaps (`Controls.version`), main: `seats`, `seat_of`,
`_on_pad_changed`, rumble per seat, pause from seat 0 only, `tests/test_local_seats.gd`.

Next: run `TEST_ONLY=local_seats,ui,touch,player_input,twinstick`, smoke `--mode=44`, push, open
PR 1 with base `local-mp-plan`; then PR 2 (join screen, `seating` templates, `--locals=N`) on
branch `local-join` based on `local-seats`.

## Decisions

- Balance and benches: Normal CPUs only, never Rage (Oct 25). No mage buffs. No parry.
- The game is "Ready 4 Rambles" to players; internals keep creature-arena.
- Chaos Cup always may draw hazards; Arena options govern the normal modes only.
- Stacked PRs: merge the base first; a stacked PR merged via the button lands on its base.

## Gate

No sim rule or balance number changes in PRs 1-4. Behavioral PRs wait for Kevin's playtest.

## Open questions (for Kevin)

- Server update to the current protocol when convenient (main NET bumps since Oct 28).
- Margin / hoarding props; touch targeting spec; kit rows; mode merges (unchanged from before).
